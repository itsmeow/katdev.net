> I came out today. It felt like falling.
>
> The pillar I built beneath myself, pushing myself forward fell below me.
>
> It stung, a cut against salted pavement.
>
> The weight of the path ahead of me lightened on my shoulders as I fell.
>
> Freedom in suffering.
>
> The path I walk becomes less lonely.
>
> The words burn against my skin.
>
> All in good intention, I see.
>
> I continue to be.
