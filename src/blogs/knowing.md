<div class="monospace pre-wrap">
all these conversations feel empty<br />
do you love anyone<br />
can't get enough<br />
words through my tongue<br />
an ant in their<br />
torrential outpour<br />
drowning of no one's doing<br />
i need more<br />
there's nothing that can sate<br />
the thirst to be<br />
known by everything<br />
because otherwise<br />
does my time outside<br />
have no meaning<br />
two lives; no sense in that<br />
make them one or kill it now<br />
i am tired<br />
can't we switch sides?<br />

</div>
