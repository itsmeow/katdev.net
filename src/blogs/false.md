<div class="monospace pre-wrap">
why can't I<br />
look at you
and see it too<br />
i know that you
must be beautiful<br />
but i see myself<br />
i see myself and
i see it wrong<br />
at the root
every minute
thing about you
points deeply to<br />
my insecurity<br />

<hr />

i look at you
i see it too<br />
i think that everyone
might see me too<br />
i know that i
should look away<br />
but i can't help but feel
that something might not go my way<br />
if i were to
appreciate you<br />
could i be
instantaneously
without; carefree

</div>
