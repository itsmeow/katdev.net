i am dust in this world's rain
wash me away
i am nothing

i am your skin
i wrap around your shoulders and flake away
airbound
carried aloft on the wind
unto the pavement outside your window
to be passed through

i am rain in this world's air
i am one in billions
i fall the furthest
and bury myself below
every arrangement of myself unique
and every ray of light penetrating to depths unexplored
i refract insight but I'm clear to see

i am dirt in this world's crust
to grow others
and tread upon
i have everything you could need
but I'm not worth a tourmaline

i am a leaf on this world's trees
i bask in your light and i give life
i am alive and i am bright
i will fall like the rest
growing red and i bleed
my husk emptied
and so lives on the tree
without me
