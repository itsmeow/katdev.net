## Boneless

---

> Life is raw.
>
> Not undercooked - raw like flesh and bones.
>
> Every breath burns, for there is no skin to protect that within.
>
> It burns, for I have been sprinting in the wind.
>
> A chatter in the distance draws them in.
>
> The bones are empty - the mind too distracted to notice.
>
> My bones are empty. They long for belonging.
>
> My bones are empty. They have no home.
>
> They need to be known, but want to be invisible. There is nothing worth seeing.
>
> I know where the marrow is, I cannot put it back. The mind is too distracted to notice.
>
> The chattering thickens - but it burns. The burning is muggy.
>
> Oppressive. Loud. Racing.
>
> The mind is distracted. It screams for freedom but there is no relief.
>
> Help find the marrow - It brings them home.
>
> Belonging with the boneless, burns.

## Okay Enough Incomprehensible Poetry

---

I've never liked poetry that doesn't explain itself clearly. The ambiguity is unhelpful, but I wanted to write it all fancy for fun.

Now I will explain the meaning of this poetry because I want to be heard and burying my thoughts in metaphors is no good.

This poem is about autism and being non-binary, and how it feels socially.

### The Burning, The Chattering

The burning represents the feeling of being overstimulated by everything. The daily experience of life - the sun, the sound of cars, a loud room full of people.

Imagine a vampire except instead of being afraid of the sun I am afraid of the sun, sound, light, and being in the presence / being perceived by other people or strangers for too long.

It burns. Not only does it burn - but I have no skin. I have no barrier between myself and this world. It feels exhausting.

The chattering is muggy - being in a muggy room, with no relief.

### The Bones

The bones represent a shell, hidden deep within, but empty. It represents my social outlook - how I feel about my relationships with others.

They are (feel) empty. They need fulfillment.

#### The Marrow

The marrow is what fills the bones. They represent my thoughts, feelings, passions, desires. They want to be seen - and the mind knows where they are - it wants to be seen, it wants to fill the bones.

The marrow is vital, it must be there - producing blood cells - but it is not. The bones are empty. So I crave fulfillment in my relationships - I want to show and be seen for who I am.

### The Mind

The mind represents anxiety. It is too distracted by the burning and the emptiness to find the marrow. I cannot express myself, because I am burning. Whether that be overstimulation or social anxiety - fear of rejection.

### Home

Home is the feeling of truly belonging somewhere. Knowing that those around you truly know you, and you know them. At a fundamental level.

### Line-specific

> It burns, for I have been sprinting in the wind.
> A chatter in the distance draws them in.

This represents a "drifting" - not finding or knowing how to belong, and so moving from place to place. Being drawn to a chatter in the distance, hoping to find what you were looking for.

> Help find the marrow - It brings them home.

Comfort is the only way to belong - but it's not that simple. I need people to understand me to be able to be understood - it's paradoxical. The marrow must be present to be home, but to put the marrow back requires you be home.

> Belonging with the boneless, burns.

Being autistic and non-binary - nothing but also everything, and having no home, because there is no one side to stick to - hurts. It feels like drowning.
