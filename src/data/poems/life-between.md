life is a game played in between things
that purgatory from happy to lonely
we all avoid it forgetting to be
i'm trying to play it
get 100% great job you won no more to see
sad though it's got too high of a difficulty
my PC's broke got the wrong I/O capacity
i think instead I'll write another poetry
easier than computing another adaptive social industry
too many classes to choose from there's the wall street bourgeoisie
manipulate another into giving you all you need
not my type of thing so I'll try another let us see
i could forget it all give into the complex and live through the screen
after a while that gets pretty unfulfilling
i'll pass on going out and work until i scream
help me out i've got nowhere to go to be unseen
i'm not that type of person i'm going to try to help others live like me
that's a tough one to solve there's no route to follow that accomplishes society
this game is not designed to play it's kind of just another E.T.
the tutorial is long and badly laid out it's got too many features and i've barely
scratched the surface and my time is running out you don't
think this is all we're meant to be?
