the dark gives rest to the mind
flanking freedom these empty streets
let you really think
freeing possibilities
i could be anything
silhouettes hold silent mysteries
a warm gust pushing across the bushes
and three rabbits hiding from the movements

the sky reflects what is underneath
and the glaring exploding sky
drops below and leaves us to be
my home is in the sky that can't be reached

where everybody is anything but
we are okay with that
where i can be alone anywhere and
tethered to the abyss
i can drift

through one to another
i drift into the arms
of the grass and
i am her;

i am the star and the planet
i am everything that eats and is eaten
i am the same but i am not
i am distinct but i return
i will return and i will live
i will live this small time as
the thing that i am and i will
feel what can be felt because
this is my time and i will have it
to its fullest and i will love
i will love everything that i am
i love this world i love you and i love everything you are
of the sky and the worms and the trees and my arms
are not big enough to hold it all
i am taking this with me and i won't forget
i will return to the earth and it will remember

i am alive
