we each watch the other, every cold, dreary night; where a brisk walk is the only thing that can warm the mind.

we walk the same path, in opposite directions, on opposite sides of the street. as I walk down the path (to nowhere in particular) I always wonder if she takes the same route that I am currently walking. back to... wherever she came from, but I've never ran into her walking any other way.

always opposite.

sometimes, we both sit on the curbside and take in the environment. we've seen each other so many times, it just feels like the right thing to do. it's our activity. I like to look at the stars. Sometimes, a neighborhood cat will visit. The cat can freely pass between us.

I wonder what her voice sounds like.

going down any other road isn't an option. we always find each other when we need to, on those dreary nights. our encounters are unplanned, but never missing. unintentional, but always necessary.

there will always be a next time, and it will always be the right time.

I wish that we smoked, so I could offer her a cigarette. Instead I stare and try to make out her outfit. What kind of person is she? Are we alike?

i've hit rock bottom and i've nothing left to show for myself

and I see her. she is walking this way. on my side of the street. and I'm going to say hello.

for the first time, we smile.
