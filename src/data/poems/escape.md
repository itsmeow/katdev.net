i am dancing, and if i ever stop i will spend every night out against a wall wishing
and i am singing but when I'm done I'll start crying
I'll birth a new life for myself

a life where I realized my worth before i could be told that i have none,
and i don't feel burdened by this trauma,
where i always seem to know what to say,
and nobody cares that I'm gay,
and I can breathe in a room filled with noise

i'm poised to fail, i see it approaching
i will burn out and nobody seems
to understand there's no way out
i don't have another ambition to take

i'm wishing for escape
