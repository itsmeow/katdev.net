there is a speckle
on an egg

the egg is from a chicken
the chicken made this egg in a day

a chicken has a few dozen organs
winding rivers of crimson elixir
travelling through

a cell among millions
this chicken too

the cell has a few dozen organs
phospholipid bilayer
transport you

an array of proteins
strands and ladders
storing who

the speckle is watched
by someone as complex as you

"that fucking speckle

the sprawling roads
directly between you

a greater system

a tail of a billion stars
right next to

another trailing spiral
glowing yellow and blue

they pull at the sky

there is a speckle
it's a star

the star is from a nebula
the nebula made this star in ten million years

the sky has a few quintillion speckles
unfathomable pillars of golden hue

you must think that
they have planets too

a planet indistinguishable from you

if the sky is watching your every move
20 billion galaxies

all watching you

if you are so concerned about a speckle
something not like you

then forget yourself
you've got nothing to lose

forget the speckle
and remember this

you are not
exactly equivalent

to what you think
is fully typical

you are a speckle
do not forget

do not be cruel
and do not be shit

the speckle is closer to you
than you'd like to admit
