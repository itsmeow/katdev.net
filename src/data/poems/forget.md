lose hope lose hope

he has shown,
at the door he knocks

"i am your salvation"
and he was not;

his orangish hue
it drips as he rots.

a time again he comes to rule
and this time without hinder.

he knows his path up to your house
and will proceed without fault.

he builds his walls
in your mind

you will not remember
those another your kind;

they are your world
thinking and feeling

those people your eyes tell differ.

he will echo your deepest truth
that you follow blindly.

despondent we are

at how you let him in;
and soon you will forget

my humanity.
