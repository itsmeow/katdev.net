step over sunsets
wreck under skin and lavender roads
bleed; our health; my starts
are falling flat on
empty skulls and serving
the Company for reasons
nobody knows

caged
the murder is fine
and straining for escape
they caw at anything that shines

i can't pass by
without paying in dime

we can't break out
but everything is fine!

fed, rested, and possibly quite blind
that is life
but the cage is empty
and fleeting

I'll bloom
in time
