i'm mourning the fact that I can't keep a spring
i would love the sound of myself when i sing
there's this feeling<br />
it's like everything<br />
i miss myself
because i can't do that<br />
not when i'm
not when<br />
i'm taffy in a candy shop
pizza dough
whatever you want<br />
there's oobleck
in my mind<br />
i think i'm moving too fast<br />
do you not think
i've been quiet lately<br />
it's because i'm getting the feeling<br />
that one it's like-<br />
god, it's just dizzying<br />
all wrong, everything<br />
