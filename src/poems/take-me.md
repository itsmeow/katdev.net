confidence
lost in bliss

begging
for a kiss
goodbye;

goodbye
ceaseless
needless
lacking

established
post-scarcity
but you're scared
of me

advertisement
inflation
and speculation,

i waste myself
for endless
pointless

attempts at
gathering labor for
my sanity

bluntly
i don't care enough

i saw ladders
i saw ladders and i ran,
where there was nothing
but snakes
biting at
my lips

frigid and wrapping;
my nervous system
with price tags

i am a resource
take it
take it.

i don't.

have enough.
for you.

take it.

because i don't
need it.

i am for you.
i am for you to take, forever
my life is yours.

my self and my attention and my time and my joy and my sadness

my friends and my home and my laughter and my jokes and my games

have them. turn them into profit.

does this make you happy?

i am powerless.
take me
