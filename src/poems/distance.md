There is a world where
We stand on the same ground
"It's raining."
"I hear."
A train whistles between words unspoken
<br />
A world that
Your presence is a night in
Warm light trickles upon our skin
A chuckle
A smile
A comfortable place; ourselves akin
<br />
If we had abandoned
Our dreams, unbound
Could we stand
Forever enwound
