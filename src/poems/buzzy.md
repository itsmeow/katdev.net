content warning: insect phobia, arachnophobia, corruption, body horror

---

fuzzy fuzzy web stuck to my skin
crawl upon my deepest within
webs buzzing on my nose
i feel it crawling in my holes

can't be free it's in my bones
that buzzy sound it drones
takes over every thought i can't let go
i'm corrupted there's always more

larvae crawling in my mouth i can't get it out
get it out i can't
get it out they're all around me
please please please please please
every prickle and brush of wind is insects picking at my skin
i swat at nothing to get rid
there's a spider in my hair
there's A SPIDER in my hair and i can't see it
how how how how
get it out i can't i don't want to touch it and i'll freak out
i can run to safety but with safety there is light

and how they love the light.

they're there and they are everywhere and they are everywhere and i can't get out please please run away there's nowhere to go but forward and they're there i can see them please don't make go that way i want inside please let me inside open the door so i can run past there is no one around and no way out

buzz bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzz- SLAM it's hit my face
it's in my mouth oh please get out
swarms of hard exoskeletons and legs and massive eyes that stare no thoughts to even compare they're not even all there they just watch and mate and pair and eggs in my hair i can't stop them and i'm itching it's not fair
i am dirty dirty now i have to get them off
brush myself and webs slide off
ants in my food can't be free
they're permeating me

my hair is webs inviting spiders to crawl within and every drop of sweat is crawling... crawling
my fingers are legs and my eyes are eggs

stop it now please stop it now i can't breathe or drown them out
