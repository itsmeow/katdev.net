i look into her eyes and see
myself who am I?

change is eternal
and it always wins the race
entropy dictates
that I must swap face

she is me and I am her
and we shift in time
past forgotten

I am her
and who will I become?
what humanity
lies next, ahead in time?

my head is filled
with selves untold
i was you and now I'm me
who will take my place?

i am dying every second.
i am becoming someone else

i look into her eyes
is that me?
but I'm a guy

if that truth is gone
what comes next?
who is her successor?

i die again;
every moment;
unfolding;
i open my eyes
