we watched the sky drop / off the window / they flick off at 5
we'll be underneath / forgetting the drive / to places we can't be
in time but / you can't forget me / I'm bound

a web of mind / elastic please / in wasteful ether
the graveyard / that holds home / the bitter swathes
untangle from / your obligations / live your rainstorm

I'm leaving this place holding love
for everyone except not this one time
we're not supposed to be temporary
you know as well as me

if I don't see you / it's okay / remember
i give my everything / i know / it's not the same
even if you don't / reciprocate / i want us to remain

i'd rather stay the same

thanks again for listening
I'll do my best to catch

the raindrops
through our web
and send them
your `[tannery]` way
