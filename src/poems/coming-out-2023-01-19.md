I came out today. It felt like falling.<br />
The pillar I built beneath myself, pushing myself forward fell below me.<br />
It stung, a cut against salted pavement.<br />
The weight of the path ahead of me lightened on my shoulders as I fell.<br />
Freedom in suffering.<br />
The path I walk becomes less lonely.<br />
The words burn against my skin.<br />
All in good intention, I see.<br />
I continue to be.<br />
