who are you

were you
born
from womb
like me?

were you
the one
who cried
at times?

you lost
that love
for joy

and gained
that hate
for odds

i think
i've lost
the game

we
are not
your pain

does my life
haunt you
unduly imbued?

how I act
and think
is too
important to you?

i am
just one
living, like you

think
about
how you
are special

et tu?
