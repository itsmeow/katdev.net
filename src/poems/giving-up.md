i built legos on your floor
you tell me about your life and
you're so busy you can't think

i'm building them for you and
i hear you say that there's no time
i'm sitting on your floor because i can't come with you

i watch you with the others
they look like you care
but i'm not sure you do
you'd tell me if you wanted to

i need to get up
and work on us somewhere else
you can sit on my floor
i tell you that every night
but you never will
you don't have the time

forget it
i'll keep waiting for a word
while you keep forgetting who we were
i'll kiss someone else but always think about what
i built with you
i'm going to take it apart soon
