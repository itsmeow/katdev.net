i know that i am stressed
for i can feel it in my chest

the racing of the thoughts
that everything is nought

the pain that lacks purpose
and shakes me furthest

there isn't enough time
but all the same
given to everyone every day
the same that i have been given
and living since my origin

lacking in prediction
it removes my volition
there is nothing but dejection
for there's nothing to emblazon
no change to be driven
my time is worthless and I'm livid
that nothing matters but my impression
it's all just an illusion
to drive some institution
