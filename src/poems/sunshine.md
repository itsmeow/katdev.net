my dear I hope<br />
you find and know<br />
someone will think
what makes you fall to the brink
and what makes you shrink<br />
is brilliant and hot pink
atop your head they can see
your nature, it's beloved to those who see<br />
i would listen to you tell me
about the density of a black hole
and the fact of a supernova<br />
of one-point-seven and the Pandorica
of a Rust-y Mid-Tower Unite<br />
of a Paper hero and how to fold
a wheel to ride upon<br />
of bats abound and
fans, the sound
of disconnected boards<br />
i would tell you how
they hear it now<br />
that glaring golden star
it has been there
in your hands and<br />
you do not have to hide it
upon your face
atop your helm
within your mind<br />
your words are loved
there's more to find
do not give up<br />
your autistic sunshine
