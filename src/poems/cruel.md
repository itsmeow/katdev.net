forget what to say
there's an opportunity
opened when you said
something I can deprecate for effect

connect to the past
when all that I was given in stead
was the voices they said
jokes at my expense
to be funny and it was

so when i hear that door
i throw the same in
i forget what to say
so it fills the void in sentences

except it wasn't funny i'm
connecting the wrong way
negative influence on your day
i'm cruel and i can't see that

it hurts to hear
i'm sorry i
love spending time together i
didn't see how i
could be mean when i
never meant to be i
just say things i
don't always think i
just shout the first thing that comes to mind.
