old friend don't forgetme

let's go back to your house and play skate3
on your single-child no siblingtv

that's really the problem withme
nothing has the same simplicity

you've got to ask too many questions
can't remember to say "what about you?"

i'd probably fly 10,000 miles just tosee
if there's a chance someone could holdme

really that's not what i want to do
i want to invest in you no more index fund
it's difficult though let me explain

i really do feel so much damn empathy
i cry when everytime i watch the tv
i just can't shake the complexity

i can't care anymore i'm tired yousee
to live in a world not designed tobe

forget it and just kissme
maybe it'll make me feel like i'm not some specialty
some thing designed to be on display
no flash photography

i'm gonna miss my flight too
carrying too many bags for us i'm
forgetting your name it's
not helpful i'd rather find something we have in common

trying not to make the conversation all about me
i've got scripts in my head and they don't solve anything
i don't like skipping the boarding it's important to me
i'm just really not any good at it and it's killing me

and i really always need reminding that
i'm not fucking everything up but here's the thing
i probably am and i mightbe
completely oblivious you need tosee
i'm trying so desperately

to be whatever you might want me
but really i should just 'be myself' you've forgotten what you can't know
if i did that god forbid anyone should even speak to me
and it's not like anyone tries to reassure this fact
that myself is something worth showing
no i'm most liked quite randomly i can't find the thing that sticks you to me

share what you will with me
i won't ask properly because
i pay in advance
you forget that i always give you a chance
i thought that was the question i missed
but i have to explicitly say everything
because i'm not you and you're not me
and my brain is a goddamn mystery

i'm shit and small talk and i don't know how to show that i care about people
i try but i'm really quite a miss at offering anything past a daily conversation
i'm terrified of gifts they really stress me
i'd do whatever you need but you really gotta ask me
it's not something i plan ahead on the daily
i'm not you and you're not me so i don't expect any more from you
i'm not the type to invite myself along
can't flirt with a touch that's too much for me
and it's hard to gauge what words to say to brighten a day
i'm bad at caring your way
i show it by listening listening oh listening so
i'll back you up and i'll spend way too much time on you
i'll learn what makes you tick and probably try to help with everything you do
i'll speak your language if it lets me know more about you
i'll tell you that i'm thinking of you
and make a stupid joke that reminds you of how
we're still kids it's not that deep please remove the complexity

did i do it wrong let me rethink how i said that and
analyze that conversation your reactions what
was that face do you hate me
no wait i'm just remembering wrong i'm
likable that's what everyone tells me
when friday rolls around you'll see i
left early i can't take the noise it dysregulates me
but now they won't take me back i wasn't laughing enough i'm not a great friend
a hang out for me is something more chill but
it's not something for the groups with too much energy
i prefer when it's just us three

you're my best friend until you don't want to be
it's hard for me to give what
i never learned naturally

i'm at the edge of normalcy
i can know how to act
but forget how to be

i'd rather give up
do what you want with me
maybe it'll make me happy
how do you touch
someone you can't care to see?

and am I asking you or are you asking me?
