how every second together
decomposes to waste
how you spend forever
chasing another face

this immature fiending
for ceaseless climax
and remember to check
your watch and look

at me

I'm here.

you won't laugh
or ask how I've been

i always dream

of a day you aren't hungry

lost cause
you always find
another distraction


and think of how it withers
how shallow our roots
blow away on another stem

you laugh,
but we're not even good friends
you don't invite me to
your thoughts or your room

every chance to grow was given up
for some man

is your hobby being a bad friend?

lie and say you love me
but you can't spend a second
to do a thing my way
or remember who I am
