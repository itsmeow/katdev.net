life is bursting at the seams

with dread

and how it gleams

in my head

the future is bright
dry, incandescent

we could take flight
burn alight, when

there's not a life to live
or a tree to be found
denser things grow and
nothing and everything makes sound
not a person to know but
they're crushing us down
don't care don't care don't care
not fair not fair not fair
spare us
i'm scared
