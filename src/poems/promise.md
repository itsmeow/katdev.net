a crunch falls upon the ground
a lucky foot to grab it must be sound
with great pace she evades all around
moving ever faster to avoid she is wound
crunching powder it freezes her down
there is nothing to pursue, not a sound
she is running altogether regardless and won't be found
her future love passed by for there is not a round
globe within which she could be safely bound<br />
<br />

> wait...

she is begged to stop and look around<br />

<br />

> love

<br />
<br />

> I need you

<br />
<br />
<br />

> don't let me go

<br /><br /><br />

she evades your brown eyes
staring through the window at abyss
solid magenta gazing at anything but you<br />

she says it's `nothing` and
she looks for another step
upon which to continue
forever unbound<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

> i do.

<br />
<br />
smiling,
<br />

> i do.

<br />
<br />
<br />
slow down, slow down, slow down
she is safe here and cannot be held down
i'm screaming that
surely it's true i've said so to you<br />

but she knows better
it's her home
it all passes by in moments
whirring hyper-speed panels glowing gentle lights
freeze through the soul engulfing this world
the winds blow across
space that's no longer empty and the stars drop like snowfall
fly away `ST3LL4R`

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

> she was nothing to anyone, really, wasn't she?

can any promise be held when you, I, and we fizzle like breaths in a frigid world's wind

we live on an island of the dead
