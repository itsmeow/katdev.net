May the sea be calm
Our paths be clear

May we find that nobody is here
To take the ones that we find dear

My dreams are simple
to live without fear

I will fly away
And pass
The seagull's pier

My mind will wander
to the enemy's spear

I pierce myself
upon his glare

I tell myself
nobody's there

I see his face
He's filled with fear

At death, I find
My enemy is dear
