to know you
to know you

i know you
i know you think about me
i know you think about what you think you thought you said
i know you can only think about it
synapses fire through your head

i know the connections
unpruned, electrical impulses
thoughtless yet meticulous
you've got to stop, you're repulsive

i know you're wired into yourself
feedback loop
for all i hear you whispering:

you're trying too hard
you've got to stop being so loud
they see you as a man
you're too quiet
they're not interested
that was weird
you're a creep
there's nothing you can do

self-analyze maybe
it'll solve your lack of parity
not too caught up in
reviewing for the test

to know you
to know you
to know me

you relentlessly ruminate
