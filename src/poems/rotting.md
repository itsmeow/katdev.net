screeching; she fills the air with

our suffering it's all there is to hear
and I fear that

the very ground beneath is exploding
the grass peeling away from
a rotten core

I and 5 billion knives, planted in her flesh
and nobody cares

we've lost the chance
to fix it

I'll dance
until it takes me too
until I'm screaming
my life unfolding

and it comes for me
i'll say I cared
I did, I do

but I am not
5 billion whos
and I do not
know how to stop you

there is no fix
or bandages
for 5 billion stab wounds
