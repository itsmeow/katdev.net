## Development

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) v22.
2. Run `corepack enable` (as Administrator) to add the yarn binary to your system PATH. (If for some reason `corepack` isn't a valid command, try `npm install -g corepack` first)
3. Restart your terminal and run `yarn install`.
4. Restart VSCode, opening the main repository folder as a project. Install the recommended extensions (ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript), then restart your VSCode. Ensure you press "Allow" when VSCode asks if you want to enable TypeScript.
5. Start a development server by running the command `yarn run dev`.
6. To make a production build, use `yarn run build`.
